## A terminal based mini game made in ARM assembly
### Current state
Right now, only a basic system to make random "lasers" appear on the upper and bottom sides of the screen is implemented.  

### Goal
In the finished game the player will control a "spacecraft" and will have to avoid being hit by a laser.
